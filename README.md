Recently, many reserachers are trying to build automatic helpdesk systems. However, there are very few methods to evaluate such systems. In DialEval-2, we aim to explore methods to evaluate task-oriented, multi-round, textual dialogue systems automatically. This dataset have the following features:
* Chinese customer-helpdesk dialogues carwled from Weibo.
* English dialgoues: manually translated from the Chinese dialgoues.
* Nugget type annotatoins for each turn: indicate whether the current turn is useful to accomplish the task.
* Quality annotation for each dialogue.
  * task accomplishment
  * customer satisfaction
  * dialogue effectiveness
